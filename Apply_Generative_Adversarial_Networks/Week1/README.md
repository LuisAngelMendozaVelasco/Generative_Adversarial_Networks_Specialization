# Week 1: GANs for Data Augmentation and Privacy

Learn different applications of GANs, understand the pros/cons of using them for data augmentation, and see how they can improve downstream AI models!

## Learning Objectives

- Explore different applications of GANs and examine their specific applications in data augmentation, privacy, and anonymity.
- Improve your downstream AI models with GAN-generated data.
