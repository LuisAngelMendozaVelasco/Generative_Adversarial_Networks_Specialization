# Week 3: Unpaired Translation with CycleGAN

Understand how unpaired image-to-image translation differs from paired translation, learn how CycleGAN implements this model using two GANs, and implement a CycleGAN to transform between horses and zebras!

## Learning Objectives

- Compare paired image-to-image translation to unpaired image-to-image translation.
- Identify how their key difference necessitates a different GAN architecture.
- Implement unpaired image-to-image translation model, called CycleGAN, to adapt horses to zebras (and vice versa) with two GANs in one.
