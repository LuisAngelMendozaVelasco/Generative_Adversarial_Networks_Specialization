# Week 3: StyleGAN and Advancements

Learn how StyleGAN improves upon previous models and implement the components and the techniques associated with StyleGAN, currently the most state-of-the-art GAN with powerful capabilities!

## Learning Objectives

- Analyze key advancements of GANs.
- Build and compose the components of StyleGAN.
- Investigate the controllability, fidelity, and diversity of StyleGAN outputs.
