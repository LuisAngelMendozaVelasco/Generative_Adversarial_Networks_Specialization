# Week 2: Deep Convolutional GANs

Learn about different activation functions, batch normalization, and transposed convolutions to tune your GAN architecture and apply them to build an advanced DCGAN specifically for processing images!

## Learning Objectives

- Be able to explain the components of a Deep Convolutional GAN.
- Compose a Deep Convolutional GAN using these components.
- Examine the difference between upsampling and transposed convolutions.
