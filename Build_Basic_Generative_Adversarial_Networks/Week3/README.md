# Week 3: Wasserstein GANs with Gradient Penalty

Learn advanced techniques to reduce instances of GAN failure due to imbalances between the generator and discriminator! Implement a WGAN to mitigate unstable training and mode collapse using W-Loss and Lipschitz Continuity enforcement.

## Learning Objectives

- Examine the cause and effect of an issue in GAN training known as mode collapse.
- Implement a Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty to remedy mode collapse.
- Understand the motivation and condition needed for Wasserstein-Loss.
